A quickly put together slideshow for displaying browser test results from crossbrowsertesting.com on a big screen in the office

To setup:

- make a copy of config/config.php.example and rename as config/config.php
- edit config.php with your details and the crossbrowsertesting.com test IDs you want to display
- create a directory called /data and make it writable
